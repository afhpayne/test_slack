Qt6Keychain

Qt6Keychain is a Qt API to store passwords and other secret data
securely. How the data is stored depends on the platform:

Linux/Unix: If running, GNOME Keyring is used, otherwise QtKeychain
tries to use KWallet (via D-Bus), if available. Libsecret (common
API for desktop-specific solutions) is also supported.

Note:
This build uses the BUILD_WITH_QT6 flag and works only with qt6.
