Ardour is a professional digital workstation for working with audio and
MIDI.

Ardour is meant forâ€¦

Audio Engineers
Ardour's core user group: people who want to record, edit, mix and
master audio and MIDI projects. When you need complete control over
your tools, when the limitations of other designs get in the way,
when you plan to spend hours or days working on a session, Ardour is
there to make things work the way you want them to.

Musicians
Being the best tool to record talented performers on actual instruments
has always been a top priority for Ardour. Rather than being focused on
electronic and pop music idioms, Ardour steps out of the way to
encourage the creative process to remain where it always has been: a
musician playing a carefully designed and well built instrument.

Soundtrack Editors
Sample accurate sync and shared transport control with video playback
tools allows Ardour to provide a fast and natural environment for
creating and editing soundtracks for film and video projects.

Composers
Arrange audio and MIDI using the same tools and same workflow. Use
external hardware synthesizers or software instruments as sound
sources. From sound design to electro-acoustic composition to dense
multitrack MIDI editing, Ardour can help.
