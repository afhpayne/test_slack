The computer Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files
from Nextcloud Server with your computer.                           

Use the desktop clients to keep your files synchronized between your
Nextcloud server and your desktop. Select one or more directories on
your local machine and always have access to your latest files wherever
you are.

Notes:
This builds the Nextcloud desktop client from source.
On an Intel i7 the build is about 5 minutes.
